# Limework fork of RedisBungee

Spigot link: [click](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/redisbungee.87700/)

The maintainer of RedisBungee has became inactive, so we have taken the development of the plugin.

RedisBungee bridges [Redis](http://redis.io) and BungeeCord together. 


This currently deployed on [Govindas limework!](https://Limework.net) 

## Compiling

Now you can use maven without installing it using Maven wrapper [github?](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) :)

RedisBungee is distributed as a [maven](http://maven.apache.org) project. To compile it and install it in your local Maven repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Limework/RedisBungee.git
    cd RedisBungee
    mvnw clean install



## Javadocs
Hosted on limework website. Version 0.6.0 (note: any version 0.6.* will not have API changes.)

## Configuration

**REDISBUNGEE REQUIRES A REDIS SERVER**, preferably with reasonably low latency. The default [config](https://github.com/minecrafter/RedisBungee/blob/master/src/main/resources/example_config.yml) is saved when the plugin first starts.
